# NIMEN

Nimen is an adventure game in which the player can be anything.

The name "nimen" comes from Sambahsa and means "nobody", I chose this name because the character's player is not the chosen one, is not acomppanied by the strongest spirit/demon, is not from the upper class, doesn't have a special talent, however the character can become anything.

## It is available for the following platform

* Web *(in WebAssembly format)*
